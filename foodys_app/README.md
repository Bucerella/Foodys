# foodys_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a simple Foody App. <br>
Foody app inside, Category - Favourite - Home screens included. <br>
Home Screen & Categories & inside Categories  ; it can see photos line 1.<br>
My Basket screen --> You can add and remove items from the My Cart screen; it can see photos line 2.<br>
My basket screen empty, fav screen and category item detail screen it seems photos line 3. <br>
I used fake api. Because I couldn't find real suitable api for this application and I didn't like it. So i created fake api and i used them. <br> Also in this application, I used the Scoped Model architecture for state management. Because this is a simple starter app and not very comprehensive. And for now I used  and know this as I implemented Scoped Model better.
I also kept the favorite list in the phone database. Favorites can be displayed again if the application is restarted. <br><br>
I also took care to write all the duplicate widgets in DRY code. These are all created and used as short widgets under lib - view - utilities_widgets. There are still places to write cleaner, of course, but that's all I've done for now. And all the posts in the application were created and used as constants. I not like same use in the app, "Text name" bla bla. So i created constants for text lines.  <br><br>
If you want, watch app video please go to the assets file and download <a href="https://github.com/Bucerella/Foodys/blob/master/foodys_app/assets/vÄ±deo.mp4">video.mp4</a> file.<br><br>

Also i added very tiny smoke/widget test in the widget_test.dart inside. Not complicated just simple test.
